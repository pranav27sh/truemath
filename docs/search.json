    "text": "Hello everyone. I have recently decided to start with Galois Theory in view of my long term goal of studying Algebraic Number Theory. Now maybe I am being a bit desperate here since for Galois Theory one also needs a good understanding of field theory which for me, is a bit rusty at the moment. I have taken a course in introductory abstract algebra at my university in my previous semester (IIIrd sem), which was fairly basic, was taught upto ring theory, also excluding some important portions of group and ring theory. The book that was followed was Gallian. My goal in this post is to revise (and record) the key results, theorems and ideas in ring and field theory especially, which will be of prime importance for starting with Galois Theory. This will be just a collection of theorems and results and I would not include proofs of them here (maybe will add them gradually in the future), as it takes much more time. Also, not having the proofs written down will allow me to try and recall the proof strategy each time I will have to convince myself of the theorem, improving my understanding of the proof in the process.\n\n\nMy plan is that for the revision upto field theory, I will be following Gallian. After reaching there, I will switch to Dummit and Foote for the Galois Theory itself. I have also enrolled in the NPTEL course for Galois Theory this sem, which is being taught by Prof. Krishna Hanumanthu and I will be following that course closely too (Link of the playlist here). Pretty excited for what lies ahead!\n\nEdit: A minor change in the plan. Will be studying field theory mainly from Dummit and Foote. Target day for completion of field theory: 3rd of Febraury"
