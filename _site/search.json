The paper was on the convolution sum of divisor function (I will try to explain this in detail a little later). In its introduction, it talked about the result of Ingham which established asymptotic bounds for the shifted and additive convolution sum of the divisor function. Through the reference given in that paper I accessed the original paper of Ingham which had the following results:\nThese were somewhat interesting to me and now I wanted to understand how these formulae were proven.

This was very exciting for me when I understood what the problem said. Particularly the list of improvements of the order of the bound by some great mathematicians was very inspiring. More so becuase it was again one of the many examples in mathematics of how generations of great mathematicians put their intellectual power across centuries to tackle a difficult problem at hand. Wonderful! And still there is this problem, this question whose answer no one in humanity in the past and present ‘knows’ for sure.\n\n\nHistorical Development"

This will be just a collection of theorems and results and I would not include proofs of them here, as it takes much more time.
