This is a post with executable code.


::: {#def-first}

## Important definition

A number $a$ is called *positivie* if $a>0$.

::: 

::: {#thm-first}

## Important theorem

If $a>b$ and $b>c$ then $a>c$.

::: 

::: {#rem-first}

## Important remark

The property in @thm-first is called ``transitivity''.

::: 
    
::: {#nt-first}

## Commutation relations

We are going to discuss now commutation relations.

::: 

This example Quarto markdown file demonstrates the use of the `callouty-theorem` filter.

### Examples

:::{#prp-pr-number}

If there exists a primitive root modulo $n$, then there are exactly $\varphi(\varphi(n))$ primitive roots modulo $n$.
:::

:::{#thm-pr-existence}

## Existence of primitive roots

Primitive roots modulo $n$ exists if and only if $n = 2, 4, p^k, 2p^k$ for an odd prime $p$ and a positive integer $k$.
:::

:::{.proof}

## Proof of [@prp-pr-number]

We note that the primitive roots modulo $n$ is exactly the generators of the group of units modulo $n$. By the hypothesis, the group of units modulo $n$ is cyclic, thus having $\varphi(\varphi(n))$ generators.
:::

:::{.remark}

Group theory greatly simplifies the proof of the theorem.
:::

:::{#exr-quadratic-residue}

Prove that the quadratic residues modulo $p$ form a subgroup of the group of units modulo $p$ of index $2$.
:::

:::{#sol-quadratic-residue}

## Solution to [@exr-quadratic-residue]

Use the fact that the group of units modulo $p$ is cyclic.
:::

### On default behaviors

:::{#cor-default}

## Default style

If you set the metadata of a theorem type to `default`, it will be rendered like this.
:::

:::{#def-default}

## Default style without title

`callout` can also be set to `default` in the metadata.
:::

:::{#cnj-nil}

## As is

Theorem types not specified in the metadata will be rendered as is.
